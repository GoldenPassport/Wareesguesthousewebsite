AUTOMATIC FAVICON GENERATION
==============================

Your project is now set up to automatically generate all favicon files
during the build process using a Vite plugin!

QUICK SETUP (One-Time)
-----------------------
1. In Figma Make, right-click the logo at the top of your webpage
2. Click "Save Image As..."
3. Save it as: logo.png
4. Place it in the /public/ folder of your project
5. That's it! Favicons will auto-generate on every build

WHAT HAPPENS AUTOMATICALLY
----------------------------
During every build (npm run build), the plugin will:
✓ Read /public/logo.png as the source
✓ Generate all required favicon sizes:
  - favicon.ico (multi-size)
  - favicon-16x16.png
  - favicon-32x32.png
  - apple-touch-icon.png (180x180 for iOS)
✓ Update site.webmanifest with the correct settings
✓ Place all files in /public/ folder

FILES GENERATED
----------------
After running 'npm run build', you'll see:
- /public/favicon.ico
- /public/favicon-16x16.png
- /public/favicon-32x32.png
- /public/apple-touch-icon.png

These files are already referenced in /src/app/components/seo-head.tsx

HOW IT WORKS
-------------
The Vite plugin is configured in /vite.config.ts:

  faviconPlugin({
    logo: 'public/logo.png',
    outputPath: 'public',
  })

The plugin uses the 'favicons' package to generate all sizes from your
source logo image. This runs automatically during the build process.

CUSTOMIZATION
--------------
To customize favicon settings (like background color, app name, etc.):
1. Open /vite-favicon-plugin.ts
2. Edit the 'configuration' object in the buildStart() function
3. Current settings:
   - App Name: "Waree's Guesthouse"
   - Background: #ffffff (white)
   - Theme Color: #0a3d3d (teal)

TESTING
-------
After building:
1. Run: npm run build
2. Check /public/ folder for generated favicon files
3. Serve the dist folder to test: npx serve dist
4. Open in browser and check the favicon in the browser tab

DEPLOYMENT
-----------
When you deploy (to Vercel, Netlify, etc.):
1. Make sure /public/logo.png is committed to your repository
2. The build process will automatically generate favicons
3. They'll be included in the deployment

TROUBLESHOOTING
----------------
Problem: "Favicon generation failed"
Solution: Make sure logo.png exists in /public/ folder

Problem: "Logo file not found"
Solution: Double-check the file is named exactly "logo.png"

Problem: "Favicons not showing up"
Solution: Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
          Clear browser cache
          Check browser dev tools > Network tab for 404 errors

LOGO REQUIREMENTS
------------------
- Format: PNG or JPEG
- Recommended size: 512x512 pixels minimum
- Square aspect ratio (1:1)
- Background: Can be transparent (PNG) or solid color
- The plugin will automatically resize for all favicon sizes

NO MANUAL WORK NEEDED!
-----------------------
Unlike the previous manual approach, you don't need to:
❌ Use online favicon generators
❌ Manually create different sizes
❌ Update manifest files by hand
❌ Remember to regenerate when logo changes

Just update /public/logo.png and rebuild! 🎉
