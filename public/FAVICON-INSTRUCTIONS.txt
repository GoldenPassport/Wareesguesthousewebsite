FAVICON GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS
================================

To generate favicons from the Waree's Guesthouse logo:

METHOD 1: Using the Favicon Generator Tool (Easiest)
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Start your development server: npm run dev
2. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:5173/generate-favicon.html
3. In Figma Make, right-click on the logo at the top of the page
4. Select "Save Image As..." and save it to your computer
5. Upload the logo file in the favicon generator
6. Click "Generate Favicons"
7. Download each favicon size:
   - favicon-16x16.png
   - favicon-32x32.png
   - apple-touch-icon.png
   - favicon.ico
8. Replace the placeholder files in this /public folder with your downloaded files
9. Refresh your browser to see the new favicon

METHOD 2: Using an Online Tool
-------------------------------
1. Save the logo from Figma Make (right-click > "Save Image As...")
2. Go to: https://realfavicongenerator.net/
3. Upload your logo
4. Adjust settings if needed (keep default white background)
5. Generate and download the favicon package
6. Extract the files to this /public folder

METHOD 3: Manual Creation
--------------------------
If you have image editing software like Photoshop, GIMP, or Figma:
1. Open the logo file
2. Create new images with these dimensions:
   - 16x16 pixels → save as favicon-16x16.png
   - 32x32 pixels → save as favicon-32x32.png
   - 180x180 pixels → save as apple-touch-icon.png
3. For favicon.ico, you can use an online converter or tool
4. Place all files in this /public folder

FILES NEEDED:
-------------
✓ favicon.ico (classic favicon, 32x32 or multi-size)
✓ favicon-16x16.png (small browser tab icon)
✓ favicon-32x32.png (standard browser tab icon)
✓ apple-touch-icon.png (iOS home screen icon, 180x180)
✓ site.webmanifest (already configured)

These files are referenced in /src/app/components/seo-head.tsx
and will appear in:
- Browser tabs
- Bookmarks
- iOS home screen (when added)
- Android home screen (when added)
- Search results (some browsers)

TESTING:
--------
After adding the favicon files:
1. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete / Cmd+Shift+Delete)
2. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Check the browser tab for the favicon
4. Test on mobile by adding to home screen

IMPORTANT:
----------
- Make sure all favicon files are in the /public folder (not /src)
- Files must be named exactly as shown above
- The Vite build process will automatically copy these to /dist
- Don't delete site.webmanifest - it's required for PWA features
